# web-development-journey
In this repo I'm takeing you through my web development journey...

## I am starting my web development journey, and this README explains how the web works in simple words, the way I understand it right now.

I know this isn't a perfect or advanced explanation — it’s my learning snapshot.

## How the web works ?
 let's understand with the help of an example:
 Scenario:

 Imagine opening Uber and tapping “Book Ride.”
 You don’t see what happens — but a lot happens.

 That’s how the web works.

 ## What’s Actually Happening
 - You click a link or button → a request
 - Browser/App sends the request
 - Internet carries it across the world
 - Server thinks and prepares a response
 - Browser shows the result on your screen

 ## What the Server Sends
 - HTML → structure
 - CSS → design
 - JavaScript → interaction
 - Your browser combines them and builds the website.

 ## Always Communicating
 Every click, scroll, or update sends new requests and receives new responses — silently and fast.(it's almost a loop)

## Why This Matters:
As a web developer, I build what the server sends and how the browser responds.
